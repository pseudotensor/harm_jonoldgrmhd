1) check Toth emf at pole
2) first order algorithm fails?
   ldz algorithm and B-field instability
   HLL and B-field instability?
3) why my theta grid fails?
4) kelpify code
5) pt 512^2 a=0.9 1024^2?
6) why code fails on dumping on pt (random a bit) (debug queue)

7) lisco for real GR
8) check movies for new sims

9) try gdet slope_lim

400x200 or any sim:
1) ie: black spots at outer radial edge
2) ie: permenant bars at poles, generates shock at very first image, doesn't appear at t=0 : seems to be near where many failures occur where ie goes from being a bar to nothing near inner radial edge.
## Due to cooling function R^{-1/2} ?
3) ie: alot of striping in ie linear plot for inner radial buldge
4) ie: hot spots suddenly appear and disappear at inner radial edge
5) vr(2,0,1): periodicity in patterns
6) vr(2,1,0): long lasting pinch at poles in v_r
7) vh(3,0,0): large polar velocity in first frame (near 0 at pole?)
## Due to cooling
8) br(im5p0s1l): checkerboard
9) bh(im6p0s0l): pole seems to have non-zero bh!
10 bh(im6p0s1l): ""
11)
